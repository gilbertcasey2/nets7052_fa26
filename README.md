## Summary

Introduces computational methods for analyzing and modeling complex networks across scientific domains. Emphasizes programming-based workflows for working with network data, including data collection, cleaning, representation, and visualization. Covers foundational concepts in network analysis; random graph models; community detection; machine learning for network data; network dynamics such as diffusion, contagion, and random walks; network sampling and sparsification; temporal and spatial networks; and network comparison and reconstruction. Provides structured opportunities to implement algorithms with feedback, interpret results, and communicate network-based insights in technical and interdisciplinary contexts.

This course was previously offered as PHYS 7332 (Network Science Data II), and was renumbered to NETS/PHYS 7052 for AY26–27. It is built on the foundation of years of work and development by Matteo Chinazzi and Qian Zhang, for earlier iterations of Network Science Data.

## Getting Started

Everything runs on Northeastern's Explorer HPC cluster. Class 00 walks through the whole setup; the short version:

1. **Log in to Open OnDemand:** https://ood.explorer.northeastern.edu/
2. **Activate the class environment:**
   ```bash
   module load anaconda3/2024.06
   source /shared/EL9/explorer/anaconda3/2024.06/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
   conda activate /courses/NETS7052.202710/shared/cmns-core
   ```
   To use it in a notebook, register it as a kernel once — the OOD "Custom Anaconda Environment" checkbox only takes an environment *name*, and ours is a path, so leave it unchecked and do this instead:
   ```bash
   /courses/NETS7052.202710/shared/cmns-core/bin/python -m ipykernel install --user --name cmns-core --display-name "Python (cmns-core)"
   ```
   Launch JupyterLab from the **Courses** tab in Open OnDemand, then reload the browser tab (JupyterLab only reads the kernel list at page load), open a notebook, and pick **Kernel → Change Kernel → Python (cmns-core)**.
3. **Fork this repository** on GitHub (button in the top right).
4. **Clone your fork** into your student directory on the cluster:
   ```bash
   cd /courses/NETS7052.202710/students/$USER
   git clone <YOUR FORK URL>
   ```
5. **Track this repo as `upstream`** so you can pull updates all semester:
   ```bash
   cd nets7052_fa26
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/computational-methods-network-science/nets7052_fa26.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```
6. **Pull new material** before each class:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
   ```

Full instructions, including SSH keys and fixing common Git problems, are in [Class 00](notebooks/class_00_intro_and_setup/class_00_intro_and_setup.ipynb).

### Environments

The main environment is defined in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) (`cmns-core`: scientific Python, NetworkX, plotting). A few later classes need heavier, conflicting dependencies and get their own environment under [`envs/`](https://github.com/computational-methods-network-science/nets7052_fa26/tree/main/envs):

| Environment | Used for |
|---|---|
| `cmns-core` | most classes |
| `cmns-ml` | Classes 12–13 (machine learning; PyTorch, gensim) |
| `cmns-osmnx` | Class 22 (spatial data) |
| `cmns-igraph` | igraph / Leiden community detection |
| `cmns-graphtool` | graph-tool / Infomap |

On the cluster the shared `cmns-core` environment is already built for you at the path in step 2 — you do not need to create it. The `envs/*/setup.md` guides are there if you want to run any of this on your own machine.

### Repository Layout

```
nets7052_fa26/
├── notebooks/
│   └── class_NN_<topic>/           one folder per class meeting
├── environment.yml                 the main conda environment (cmns-core)
├── envs/                           specialized environments (ml, osmnx, igraph, graphtool)
├── data/README.md                  where the large course datasets live
├── _config.yml, _toc.yml           Jupyter Book configuration
└── README.md
```

Notebooks go up before each class, not all at once. If the folder for a class isn't there yet, that's why — pull from `upstream` (step 6 above) before class and it'll be there. Class numbers here match the syllabus.

### Data

The big datasets aren't in this repo — they're too large to commit. They live on the cluster at `/courses/NETS7052.202710/data/`, readable by everyone in the class. [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) has the file list and how to point a notebook at them.

## Course Learning Outcomes

1. Develop and maintain software to analyze networks derived from a range of data sources, including real-world and simulated datasets.
2. Implement network algorithms to measure clustering, path lengths, spectra, community structure, and dynamics, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and computational proficiency.
3. Construct reproducible data analyses that integrate high-performance computing resources (e.g., the Explorer cluster at Northeastern University) for handling large-scale network data.
4. Design and code generative network models to simulate network growth, structure, and dynamics, and apply these models for inference from empirical data.
5. Collect network data online through web scraping, incorporating data collection ethics and norms.
6. Create and present pedagogical materials (e.g., a Jupyter Book chapter) on an advanced network analysis topic not covered in lectures, communicating technical ideas clearly to both specialist and non-specialist audiences.

## Course Materials

Our main resource for the course is the ever-growing Jupyter Book, where we will host the Python notebooks used in this class: https://computational-methods-network-science.github.io/nets7052_fa26/. Beyond that, there are no required materials for this course, but we will periodically draw from:

- Bagrow & Ahn (2024). ***Working with Network Data: A Data Science Perspective***. Cambridge University Press; 1st Edition; 978-1009212595. https://www.cambridge.org/network-data

Additionally, we recommend engagement with other useful network science and/or Python materials:

- Barabási (2016). ***Network Science***. Cambridge University Press; 1st Edition; 978-1107076266. http://networksciencebook.com
- Newman (2018). ***Networks***. Oxford University Press; 2nd Edition; 978-0198805090. https://global.oup.com/academic/product/networks-9780198805090

## Coursework, Class Structure, Grading

**Logistics.** This is a twice-weekly hands-on class that emphasizes building experience with coding. This does not necessarily mean every second of every class will be live-coding, but it will inevitably come up in how the class is taught. I am always on the lookout for improving the pedagogical approach to this material, and I welcome feedback on class structure. This course assumes prior experience with Python and basic linear algebra/probability; a short Python refresher is provided in Class 1 (Mon, Sep 14).

**Cluster workflows.** This course is delivered primarily on Northeastern's high-performance computing cluster. We will (a) provide a course baseline environment (conda) for interactive work (via Open OnDemand/SSH), (b) demonstrate how to clone and customize per-student environments reproducibly, and (c) run heavy jobs on compute nodes as needed. If an environment breaks, students can revert to the baseline. [Class 00](notebooks/class_00_intro_and_setup/class_00_intro_and_setup.ipynb) walks through all of it on day one.

**Grading.** This course is graded as follows:

- Class Attendance & Participation: 10%
- Problem Sets: 45%
- Mid-Semester Project Presentation: 15%
- Final Project — Presentation & Report: 30%

## Final Project

The final project for this course is a chance for students to synthesize their knowledge of network analysis into pedagogical materials around a topic of their choosing. Modeled after chapters in the Jupyter book for this course, students will be required to make a new "chapter" for our class's textbook; this requires creating a thoroughly documented Python notebook that explains an advanced topic that was not deeply explored in the course. Students are required to conduct their own research into the background of the technique, the original paper(s) introducing the topic, and how/if it is currently used in today's network analysis literature. These chapters should contain informative data visualizations that build on one another, section-by-section. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the coding skills gained in this course, doing so by learning a new network analysis technique and sharing it with members of the class. Halfway through the semester, there will be project update presentations where students receive class and instructor feedback on their project topics.
